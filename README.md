# Network Programming with Rust [Video]
This is the code repository for [Network Programming with Rust [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/network-programming-rust-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789348071), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Rust is low-level enough to provide fine-grained control over memory while providing safety through compile-time validation. This makes it uniquely suitable for writing low-level networking applications.

This course is divided into three main parts that will take you on an exciting journey of building a fully functional web server. Given the importance of security for modern systems, you will see how Rust supports common primitives such as TLS and public-key cryptography.

This course will get you started with building networking software in Rust by taking you through all the essential concepts. After watching this course, you will be more than confident enough to use Rust to build effective networking software
